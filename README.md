# weather-api
In this project, we'll create a web application that fetches weather data from a weather API and displays it to the user. The application will be built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for fetching data from the API and updating the UI dynamically.

Features:

User Input: The user can input the name of a city or a zip code to get the weather data.
Weather Display: The application will display the current weather conditions, including temperature, description, and icon representing the weather condition.
Responsive Design: The UI will be designed to be responsive and accessible across different devices.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Used for structuring the web page and defining the input field and weather display area.
CSS: Used for styling the elements, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Used for fetching data from the weather API, processing the response, and updating the UI dynamically.
Project Implementation:

HTML Structure: Create the basic structure of the web page including input field, submit button, and weather display area.
CSS Styling: Apply styles to the elements to create an appealing UI, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
JavaScript Functionality:
Fetch weather data from the API using an HTTP request.
Parse the JSON response to extract relevant information such as temperature, description, and icon.
Update the UI with the fetched weather data dynamically.
API Integration: Utilize a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap API) to fetch weather data based on the user's input.
Error Handling: Implement error handling to display a message if there's an issue with fetching the data or if the user input is invalid.
Testing: Test the application to ensure it works as expected, including checking different cities and zip codes.
Deployment: Deploy the application to a web hosting platform so that it can be accessed by users.
Conclusion:
By integrating a weather API with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we've created a dynamic web application that provides users with current weather information based on their input. This project demonstrates the use of front-end technologies to create functional and interactive web applications that fetch data from external APIs.
